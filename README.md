# Requirements
Requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) -- includes `npm`.
Everything else can be got via `npm install`.

# Running Tests
After `npm install`ing the dependencies, just run `npm test` to see the results.

# Running the Program
There is no executable, on account of there being no specification on that.
Given that, the public interface of `BeverageDispenser` should be 
straightforward enough for easy application and integration.
